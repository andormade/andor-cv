# Andor Polgar's CV generator

andor-cv is a command line tool for generating Andor Polgar's CV. It is used mostly by Andor, otherwise it could be interesting for you only if you were a tech recruiter or something.

## Install

You need to have at least node v9.1.0 to make it work. You can download it from npm:

    $ npm install andor-cv -g

or you can clone this repository and install it by yourself:

    $ git clone https://github.com/andormade/andor-cv.git
    $ cd andor-cv
    $ npm install -g

Then running the command "andor-cv" will generate and save the CV to the current directory.

    $ andor-cv

Or you can just download a pre-generated pdf from here.
