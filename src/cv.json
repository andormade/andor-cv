	"introduction": "I built my first website when I was 12 years old. I figured out HTML by experimenting and chagning the source code of other websites on the internet. My first big project was to take over the maintenance of my school's website when I was 14 years old. As a kid, I always wanted to be an embedded system developer, but to pay my tutiton and my living costs in Budapest, I had to start building websites for money. That's how I end up in the industry.",
